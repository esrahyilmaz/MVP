	<span lang=EN-US>This XTDForce Background Screening Agreement (the "Agreement") is entered into as of <u>01/22/2021</u> (the "Effective Date") by and
					 between First Advantage Enterprise Screening Corporation, a Delaware corporation, with its principal place of business at 1 Concourse Parkway NE,
					 Suite 200, Atlanta, GA 30328 ("Service Provider") and <u>AutoVendorTest69284</u> ("Client") with its principal place of business at <u>2450 Cumberland Pkwy SE,Atlanta,Georgia,30339</u>
	</span>

<p class=MsoNormal style="margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:115%;text-align: justify;">
		<b><span lang=EN-US>1. <u>Description of Services</u>.</span></b>
		<span lang=EN-US>   Client is part of a screening program in which Client may order
						consumer reports ("Reports") from Service Provider for "employment purposes",
						as that term is defined under the Fair Credit Reporting Act 15 USC 1681 <i>et.
						seq.</i> ("FCRA") including but not limited to: evaluating the subject of the
						report ("Consumer") for employment, promotion, reassignment, or retention as an
						employee, volunteer or as an independent contractor ("Employment Purposes").
						Client as part of the screening program certifies that Client will order and
						use Reports for Employment Purposes only and for no other purpose. As a participant
						invited to participate in a screening process established with Service Provider
						by <u>LOCKHEED MARTIN</u> (the "Sponsor") utilizing or engaging
						Client for its services, the background screening services provided herein for
						the Client will be identified as associated with that Sponsor's screening
						program.  Reports contain the information listed on Service Provider's online
						portal, or if applicable, Schedule A (the "Services").  Service Provider does
						not provide or include any arrest record information in Reports unless such
						arrest record is part of a pending criminal action and will only provide search
						results as permitted under applicable laws. 
		</span>
		<span lang=EN-US style='letter-spacing:-.1pt'>Client may also request Services for Consumers who
						are residents of or have had residence in countries outside of the United
						States ("International Reports").

		<b><span lang=EN-US>2.     <u>Term</u>.</span></b>
		<span lang=EN-US>    Unless otherwise set forth in a Schedule A, the term of this
						Agreement shall begin on the Effective Date and continue for three (3) years
						("Initial Term"), and shall automatically renew for additional periods of
						twelve (12) months (&quot;Renewal Term&quot;), unless written notice of
						termination is provided to either party at least sixty (60) days prior to the
						expiration of the Initial Term or any Renewal Term or it is terminated by
						either party pursuant to the terms contained herein.
		</span>
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style="margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:115%;text-align: justify;">
		<b><span lang=EN-US>3.     <u>Service Fee; Invoicing</u>.  </span></b>
		<span lang=EN-US>Client shall pay to Service Provider such amounts </span>
		<span lang=EN-US>at the pre-established effective rates set forth for this program as
						shown on Service Provider's online portal or in a separate Schedule A. Fees set
						forth online or in a separate Schedule A may not include third party pass
						through costs
		</span>
		<span lang=EN-US>. Client shall pay to Service Provider the
						fees incurred for the use of the Services through the online portal at the time
						the Services are ordered unless payment arrangements and responsibility for the
						same are provided by Sponsor in which case invoices are issued to Sponsor for
						Services provided under this Agreement.  If Service Provider has agreed to
						invoice Client, then Service Provider will send Client an invoice for services
						rendered during the billing 
		</span>
		<span lang=EN-US>period <span class=MsoCommentReference>as per</span> 
						the terms</span><span lang=EN-US> set
						forth online or in a separate Schedule A.  All payments for invoiced amounts
						shall be made within thirty (30) days of the date of invoice and remitted
						through the following acceptable methods of payment: (i) electronic funds
						transfer ("EFT"), (ii) automatic clearing house ("ACH"), (iii) wire transfer,
						or (iv) check (as listed, "Acceptable Remittance"). Payments remitted through a
						method other than an Acceptable Remittance are subject to additional
						fees.&nbsp; Amounts not paid when due may accrue interest at a rate of ten percent
						(10%) per annum or the limits imposed by applicable law, whichever is lower.  
		</span>
		<span lang=EN-US>Additionally, Service Provider may suspend Services due to Client's
						failure to make timely payments in accordance with the terms set forth herein. 
		</span>
		<span lang=EN-US>Fees for services are subject to change during the term
						of the Agreement, but not more than once annually. An increase in fees shall
						not exceed the then current rate of the consumer price index for the respective
						annual term. 
		</span>
		<span lang=EN-US>Client agrees to pay any increases in
						fees, and/or surcharges imposed by Service Provider's vendors and
						subcontractors invoiced to Service Provider, as they may occur anytime during
						the term. 
		</span>
		<span lang=EN-US>The prevailing party in any action to enforce
						the terms of this Agreement shall be entitled to an award of reasonable
						attorneys' fees and costs.  Client's obligation to pay invoiced amounts is not

							Client will establish and follow security measures designed to prevent

							occurrence of a Client Security Event (as defined below), Client shall, in
							compliance with law, notify the individuals whose information was potentially
							accessed that a Client Security Event has occurred, and any other parties
							(including but not limited to regulatory entities and credit reporting

							Laws. Client agrees not to market the Reports through the Internet. Client
							warrants that Client's use of the Reports shall be for only legitimate business
							purposes relating to its business. Client shall train employees on Client's
